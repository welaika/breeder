# Configuration file for newvhost script
#
# .vhostrc is adaptable for XAMPP/MAMPP. Just add in your
# /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf a section like this:
#
# # Virtual hosts
# Include etc/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf #Already present by deafult
# Include etc/extra/sites-enabled/*
#
# and create such dir:
# mkdir /opt/lampp/etc/extra/sites-enabled/
#
# then configure your $HOME/.vhostrc accordingly

# Example configuration is based upon a Apache2 installation on Ubuntu Oneiric

# Path to the vhosts folder [ NO TRAILING SLASH ]
apacheconfpath='/etc/apache2/sites-enabled'

# the group of apache webserver ( and you must be in that group )
web_group="www-data"

# Directory in which apache will save log files [ NO TRAILING SLASH ]
logdir="/var/log"

# The Apache document root
docroot="/var/www"

# The first level domain to be applied to all created vhosts
# default; used if no other is passed through relative flag
domain_firstlevel='local'

# Server administrator email
serveradmin="root@localhost"

# MySQL server access data
mysqluser="root"
mysqlpwd=""

# A prefix to be added to all database created
db_prefix=""

# The absolute path to the MySQL executable ( needed to create the database )
# Pay attention if you're using LAMPP: to have the executable in $PATH is your
# business
mysqlcmd=$(which mysql)

# Apache2 executable ( needed to restart apache )
apachecmd="service apache2"
