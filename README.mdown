# Breeder

### Let it bring up your local virtual hosts

Breeder is crafted for developers, who want to set up a local **LAMPP** virtual
host with a single command in your terminal.

It assumes that you have already set up your LAMPP environement, and that you
know how it is configured. If you're a dev, you'll certanly know! :)

#### In a hurry

		git clone git@github.com:welaika/breeder.git
		cd breeder && sudo make install
		sudo breeder -i

Now read and edit the just created `~/.vhostrc`

		vim ~/.vhostrc

Now enjoy

		sudo breeder -s mysite

Open a browser and go to *http://mysite.local* and start coding

#### In depth

##### .vhostrc

Here you have to configure the following:

		apacheconfpath='/etc/apache2/sites-enabled'
		web_group="www-data"
		logdir="/var/log"
		docroot="/var/www"
		firstleveldomain='.local'
		serveradmin="root@localhost"
		mysqluser="root"
		mysqlpwd=""
		db_prefix=""
		mysqlcmd=$(which mysql)
		apachecmd="service apache2"

read the in-line comments and all will be clear. Drop an issue if not.

All should be adaptable for any Linux distro and for Mac, [XM]AMPP included,
if you know your business.

##### Command line options

Script must be run with `sudo`. Here the flags:

		Usage: breeder.sh -s example [options]
		Possible options are:
		    -s mysitename (mandatory, without first level domain)
		    -a '.com' (is your first level domain, default is defined in .vhostrc)
		    -d activate creation of a new DB
		    -i initialize creating .vhostrc file
		    -w bootstrap a wordless project inside my new vhost
		    -L specify a local for WordPress (defaults to it_IT)
		    -h display this help

##### The dirty work

When you call `sudo breeder -s example` will happen the following
(default .vhostrc assumed):

* `/var/www/example.local` will be created
* a stand alone vhost config for example.local will be dropped inside
`/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`. (N.B.: sites-available is not considered)
	
		<VirtualHost *:80>
		  ServerAdmin root@localhost
		  ServerName example.local

		  DocumentRoot /var/www/example.local
		  <Directory var/www/example.local>
		    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		    AllowOverride All
		    Order allow,deny
		    Allow from all
		  </Directory>

		  ErrorLog /var/log/example.local.error.log
		  # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert,
		  # emerg.
		  LogLevel debug
		  CustomLog /var/log/example.local.access.log combined
		</VirtualHost>

* `127.0.0.1 example.local` will be added in `/etc/hosts`
* will be created a database named *example*
* apache will be reloaded

##### Bootstrapping WordLess

If you'd like to bootstrap a [WordLess](http://welaika.github.com/wordless) project
than try

		sudo breeder -s example -w

or

		sudo breeder -s example -w -L en_US

This command will add these behaviours:

* install WordPress (localised, if you choosen -L flag) inside `/var/www/example.local`
* install WordLess plugin inside `/var/www/example.local/wp-content/plugins`
* initialize a fresh WordLess teheme: `/var/www/example.local/wp-content/themes/example.local`
